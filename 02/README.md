# Coding Challenge Week 2

You have a square image of size "n x n" (e.g. 40x40, 120x120, 300x300)
The image converter API only allows images with multiples of 8

_Problem: Derive an algorithm that computes the nearest multiple of 8 for your image_

example: Image of 300px x 300px
nearest: 296 and 304

**BONUS POINTS (+ Rp. 50,000)**
Find the algorithm for multiple of x (user input)
